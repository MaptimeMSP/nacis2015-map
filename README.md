Welcome Map for NACIS Annual Meeting 2015
==========

## About the Project  
The North American Cartographic Information Society [annual meeting](http://nacis.org/annual-meeting/current-meeting/) was in Minneapolis in October 2015!

[Maptime MSP](http://wwww.meetup.com/MaptimeMSP/) built a map to welcome our cartographic brothers and sisters and provide them with a map of some of our favorite places to eat, drink, and visit.  And, in the process, we learned how to create web maps and use distributed version control (Git/Github) to collaborate on a project.

The primary motivations for this project were to:
 -    Create a mobile-friendly map of favorite local spots for NACIS 2015.
 -    Provide a vehicle for new people to learn how to use Github.
 -    Collaborate on a useful project as a Maptime chapter.
 
You can find a lot more info about the project on our [wiki](../../wiki)!
